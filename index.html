        <article>Skimming involves reading quickly to get the main idea of a text.
      Reading topic sentences (usually the first sentence of a paragraph) can be an effective way of understanding the main idea of the text.

        <h2 class="h2">How to skim?</h2>
        <ul>
        
          <li> 1. Read the first paragraph attentively to get an idea of what will be discussed in the text.</li>  
          <li> 2. Read the first (and sometimes the second) sentence of each paragraph - they give the main idea of the paragraph.</li> 
          <li> 3. After you have read the first sentences, your eyes should drop down to the end of the paragraph, looking for important pieces of information, such as dates and names.</li>   
           <li>4. Read the last paragraph attentively as it may contain the summary.</li>  
        </ul>
